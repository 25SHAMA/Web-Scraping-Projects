# Book Web Scraper

This project is a simple web scraping script built with **Python**, **BeautifulSoup**, and **Requests**.  
I scraped book details from [Books to Scrape](https://books.toscrape.com/) and saved the data into a CSV file.  

## 🔎 What I Scraped
- Title of the book  
- Price  
- Availability  
- Product link  
- Image link
- Rating

## 📂 Files in this folder
- `Book-Scraper.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with the scraping code  
- `Books.csv` → Scraped data saved as a CSV file  

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the notebook `Book-Scraper.ipynb`.  
2. Run all the cells to scrape the website.  
3. The results will be saved automatically to `Books.csv`.
